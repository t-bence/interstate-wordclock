"""
This code is used to get Python data from the C++ source.
These numbers are the C++ data taken over as-is.

What I need to do is, write code to convert these numbers into
X-Y coordinates for the Python lib.
These coordinates start from the second to bottom row on the left,
so under "T√çZ", and are arranged in as a "snake". 

Tasks:
- figure out how the lib needs the coordinates
- write tests
- write code to convert the numbers into X-Y coordinates
